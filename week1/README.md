### Overview of Machine Learning

ML: Learning functions from data

- Supervised learning
	Goal: Predict a specific response variable

	- Regression: Predict the response variable Y -> numeric

	- Classification: Predict the response varibale Y -> Categorical


- Unsupervised learning
	Goal: Get some sense of an insight from data
	No response variable

	- Clustering: grouping observations

	- Density estimation

	- Outlier detection
